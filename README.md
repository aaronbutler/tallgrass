## tallgrass - knockout and Google Maps

I had many ambitious goals for this project, but ended up settling for a reasonable demonstration of knockout and several other APIs/libraries. In particular, the goals which I met include:

1. Use knockout to implement MVVM webapp.
1. Implement a Google map with a KML layer and a path animation.
1. Retrieve data from a (technical) variety of sources - xml, plain text json, jsonp.
1. Use WebWorkers constructively.
1. Use the Promise API constructively.
1. Make a visually  reasonable single-page app.
1. Follow what has become my programming induction theorem - if I can do something for 2 use cases, I can probably do it for n and n+1 use cases.

The goals I failed to meet include:

1. Use high resolution images of Mars to create a custom base map.
1. Create a custom projection to use those images.
1. Create a useful and appealing data mashup and analysis tool for Curiosity rover data.
